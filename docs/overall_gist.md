# Itera: Smart Changelog Generation

## Project Overview
Itera transforms the tedious process of writing changelogs into something effortless and intelligent. Instead of manually compiling changes, developers get AI-powered summaries that actually make sense, with zero extra work needed beyond their normal git commits.

## Why It Works

### Smart Summarization
- **Zero Extra Work**: Analyzes your existing git commits - no special formatting needed
- **Actually Readable**: Turns technical diffs into clear, human-friendly summaries
- **Context Aware**: Understands the impact and relationships between changes
- **Automatic Categorization**: Tags and categorizes changes without manual input

### Developer-First Design
- **Quick Setup**: Just point it at your repo and go
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Use the CLI, API, or beautiful web UI
- **Natural Language**: Ask questions about changes in plain English
- **Smart Search**: Find changes by topic, not just by date or commit message

### Real-World Usage
- **Changelog Generation**: Automatic, meaningful release notes
- **PR Descriptions**: Better context for code reviews
- **Knowledge Base**: Search past changes with natural language
- **Team Communication**: Share updates that non-technical team members can understand

## Core Features

### Intelligent Processing
- Understands code changes semantically
- Groups related changes automatically
