        "description": "Billing Page Enhancement:\n\u2022 Updated the `BillingPage` component in `page.jsx`, adding 14 new lines of code and modifying existing content. This change primarily involves integrating new vector icons from the `lucide-react` library, which enhances the visual representation of billing features. Icons such as `Star`, `Zap`, `Infinity`, `ChevronRight`, `Shield`, `Check`, and `Gauge` were imported and are likely used for UI elements that require these symbolic representations.\n\n\u2022 Incorporated SVG assets for major credit card companies, including American Express (`amex`), MasterCard (`mastercard`), and Visa (`visa`). This addition ensures that users can visually identify supported payment methods directly on the billing page, improving user experience and clarity.\n\n\u2022 Adjusted the context usage by importing `useContext` and `useMemo` from React, which are essential for managing and optimizing context-driven state changes. This adjustment may enhance performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders within the billing page component.\n\n\u2022 The use of the `\"use client\"` directive indicates that this component is intended to be rendered on the client side, which is critical for interactions that require immediate user feedback and dynamic content updates.",

Although the detailed changes within the component logic are not visible, the additional lines suggest enhancements or new features that require context management using `useContext` from `AppContext`.\n\n- **Styling Updates**: The `billing.scss` file has been extended with 15 new lines. These changes primarily focus on the `.billing-page` class to enhance the layout and styling:\n  - **Layout Flexibility**: Introduced `flex-direction: row` and `position: fixed` to maintain the layout across different screen sizes.\n  - **Design Consistency**: Utilized existing color variables like `$primary-color` and `$secondary-color` to ensure cohesive styling throughout the billing page.\n  - **Improved Responsiveness**: Adjustments for `.billpage-app` include column flex direction and scroll overflow, ensuring better usability on varied display sizes.",
