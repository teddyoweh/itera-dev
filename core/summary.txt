Here's the scoop on the changes made in the `auth.scss` file:

1. **File Modification**: The file `src/app/styles/auth.scss` has been modified, increasing from 994 to 997 lines.

2. **New Color Variables**: 
   - Two new variables have been added for colors: 
     - `$main-color` is set to `#7580de`.
     - `$main-color-light` is set to `#7580de8e` (a lighter variant with some transparency).

3. **Styling Rules**: 
   - The `.auth` class maintains the same structural properties, such as display settings (flexbox) for arranging children elements in a column-centered layout.
   - The background properties are already well-defined to ensure it covers the entire area, is centered, and remains fixed during scrolling.

4. **Additional Elements**: Inside the `.auth` class, thereâ€™s a `terms-notice` section defined, which has spacing applied for margin and text alignment.

Overall, it looks like this commit is primarily about enhancing the color palette for the authentication styles and possibly preparing for some visual improvements without altering the general layout or existing functionalities.
