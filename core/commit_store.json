            "summary": "Billing Page Enhancement:\n\u2022 Updated the `BillingPage` component in `page.jsx`, adding 14 new lines of code and modifying existing content. This change primarily involves integrating new vector icons from the `lucide-react` library, which enhances the visual representation of billing features. Icons such as `Star`, `Zap`, `Infinity`, `ChevronRight`, `Shield`, `Check`, and `Gauge` were imported and are likely used for UI elements that require these symbolic representations.\n\n\u2022 Incorporated SVG assets for major credit card companies, including American Express (`amex`), MasterCard (`mastercard`), and Visa (`visa`). This addition ensures that users can visually identify supported payment methods directly on the billing page, improving user experience and clarity.\n\n\u2022 Adjusted the context usage by importing `useContext` and `useMemo` from React, which are essential for managing and optimizing context-driven state changes. This adjustment may enhance performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders within the billing page component.\n\n\u2022 The use of the `\"use client\"` directive indicates that this component is intended to be rendered on the client side, which is critical for interactions that require immediate user feedback and dynamic content updates.",

This includes separating third-party library imports from local components and assets.\n- **Client Directive:** Added `\"use client\"` directive at the top of the file, ensuring that the component is rendered on the client-side, which is essential for components that rely on browser APIs or context providers.\n- **Context Usage:** Utilized `useContext` hook to access `AppContext`, allowing the component to efficiently access the user's information for personalized billing details.\n\nStyling Improvements:\n- **SCSS Integration:** Linked the `billing.scss` stylesheet to enhance the billing page's appearance. This integration is crucial for maintaining a consistent look and feel across the application.\n\nIcon and Asset Management:\n- **Icon Imports:** Added imports for various icons from `lucide-react`, including `Star`, `Zap`, `Infinity`, `ChevronRight`, `Shield`, `Check`, and `Gauge`. These icons are likely used to visually represent billing features or statuses on the page.\n- **Credit Card Logos:** Imported American Express, MasterCard, and Visa SVG assets. These logos are essential for displaying accepted payment methods, improving user trust and clarity on payment options.",
